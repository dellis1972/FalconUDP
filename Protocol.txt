  
   A FalconUDP packet in bytes
   ---------------------------
   
       [0]     Packet detail byte (see below).     

       [1]     }
       [2]     } Sequence number as UInt16
  
       [5]     } 
       [6]     } Payload Size as UInt16.
       
       [n]     }
       ...     } Payload (if any, i.e. size > 0)
       [m]     } 
       
  [ optional additional packet - if any bytes remain in datagram
 
       [m+1]   Packet detail byte (see below).
       
       [m+2]   }
       [m+3]   } Payload Size as UInt16
       
       [m+4]   } 
       ...     } Payload (if any, i.e. size > 0)
       [o]     }
  
     ... possible multiple additional packets 
   ]
  
     Packet Detail byte in bits
   --------------------------
   
       [0]     
       [1]     }
       [2]     } SendOptions  
       [3]     } 
       
       [4]     }   
       [5]     }   
       [6]     } PacketType
       [7]     }  
 

    ACKs and AntiACKs
   -----------------
   ACKs and AntiACKs are special, they are the same size as a FalonUDP header and have seq and 
   SendOptions stored at the same place, however the values have different meanings. A FalconUDP
   packet can start with an ACK or AntiACK or have them after any application packet within.

   What each FalconUDP header value corresponds to in an ACK or AntiACK:
   
   PacketType	= Will always be ACK or AntiACK
   Sequence No. = Sequence ACK or AntiACK is for
   SendOptions	= Channel ACK is for (however can be sent on any channel)
   Payload size = Milliseconds ACK or AntiACK was held by remote peer (stopover time)
       

   NOTE:
   -----
   
   Additional packets are only appended in a Falcon packet if they fit wholley within 
   without packet exceeding MAX_PACKET_SIZE.

   Additional packets have to have the same SendOptions as byte [2] in the Falcon header.
