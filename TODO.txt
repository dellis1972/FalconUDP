TODO
----
- consider determining addresses to broadcast to at time of discovery not at startup (could have changed, though it does take a little time)

Nice to have
------------
- add received packets to single collection on FalconPeer to make reading them faster (if reliable only if previous ones received else hold on to them)
- reduce number of locks!

One day
-------
- IPv6 and other underlying protocols support
- WinRT port
